Node's Event Loop
Constantly listening to dom events such as keypresses etc
Constantly listening on to events on the server side such as http requests or interval events such as timers.
Making request of a network resource such as when a networked resource was received

Node doesnt pause and reacts to events as they arrive, non blocking event driven approach
Node handles additional requests. 

getStuff(inputParam, handleResults)
second parameter is the callback parameter to the async function

Error is the first parameter to the callback function
Check the error for undefined or faultsy error number

For simple callbacks, anonymous functions are more common
getStuff(inputParam, function(error,results){
  //if error is undefined
  //do something with the results
});
var handleResult s = function(error, result){

}
